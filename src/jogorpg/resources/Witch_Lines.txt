'Come over here, little one... Oh you look so healthy...
I'm sure you could give a hand to a poor old woman like me.'
--XX--
'Why am I caged? Well... You are so young. Does't even know of the bad in the world.
A bad man put me here. Ans just because I dares to say he was wrong once. But it was a long time ago.
Everybode here works for him, but not you. Oh no... You are a visitor. Still smell like hope, and life. 
Oh, how I miss hope and life. '
--XX--
'You look like a smart kid. You see, if you take me out of here, I could use my magic.
And we could run as far as possible from the monster that put me here.
From the monster that took your sister.'
--XX--
'Of course I know about your sister. Such a fine looking lady.
A pity she had do end like that.'
--XX--
'You did not expect she'd be alive now, did you?
That monster does not spare kids. You don't want to know what he did to my beautiful daughter.
Iadala was as brigth as a morning sunshine, but that bastard took away all her light and cut off her wings.
I see now you are not going to help me. I can see in your eyes.'
--XX--
'You are going to leave me here, aren't you? Way braver filled with anger.
You have no chance against him. I should tell you this. Oh no. Do you hear it?
His monster are coming back. You have to go away, kid. But please, find him,
and make him pay for what he did to my daughter.'
