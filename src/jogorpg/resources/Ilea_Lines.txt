'You saved me! I was so afraid. That thing was going to tear me to pieces!'ï»¿

'What? No, I didn't get here on purpose! Why do you think I would do that? Those caves were filled with monsters!
I'd never get myself into a place like that on purpose!'
--XX--
'And besides, it was not my fault either! I was playing at the cave's entrance, and then I heard someone calling me.
I know what you are going to say. That I should not trust strangers, but it was not some stranger. It was mom's voice.
I assure you it was. So I went into the cave and this man grabbed me.
He said his name was Odrian and that he was going to keep me because he as alone.'
--XX--
'Don't worry. I'm not hurt. A lot.
When we got out of those awful caves he gave me food, good food. An you know how hungry I am.
I'm sorry. I should've stayed with you as dad said.'
--XX--
'Child Eater? Well, he did not look like a man that would feed me until I'm fat as a pig to eat me.
I know the way out. He told me. All we have to do is pass a portal in the throne room, and we'll be at the forest.'
--XX--
'Where it is? I'm not sure, he did not gave me liberty to wander around.
But I guess it's to the east. Seem like the only possible way. 
The other rooms are locked and all we'll get is a old mad witch that's in the castle jail.'
--XX--
'We should hurry. I think I hear another of that monsters-things approaching'
