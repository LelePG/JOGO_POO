"Good to meet you, young Stranger. Oh, who am I? 
I'm the Seer.
No, not any Seer.
I'm THE Seer."
--XX--
"If I saw your sister? Of course I saw her. Ilea, isn't it? 
A wonderful name. But I'm afraid I did not see her the way you'd want me to. 
I saw her in the future, better saying, I saw her future. You don't have to worry.
She'll be fine in the end. I guarantee."
--XX--
"Whe she is? Well, I do not see the present.
What's a Seer worthy if he can only tell what happens in the moment?
You are in the caves none, specially no kid, should enter. That's your present.
See, no good in that. Absolutely no good. As for your future... Well...
No I can't. Talking to people about their own future can be catastrofic sometimes.
As for your sister, she'll be home tomorrow."
--XX--
"You want to go find her? Well, I'm an old man in a cell.
There's not much I can halp you with. But let me think a bit. 
Yes, I see what lies in your way. You must be careful.
The way ahead of you is dangerous, and lots of monsters are waiting for you.
I can see your sister is somewhere beyond the Iron gate, oh that's not good for you.
A giant monster guards the gate's key, what a pity you have to go alone.
You must defeat the monster, ang get the key. 
Once you've crossed the gate, things will start to get better for you, young one."
 --XX--
"I cannot say much more, or I may be putting your fate in danger.
But since you ask, I'll advise you to be always equiped with some kind of weapon.
That barrel top, for example could be used as a shield. You are a fool to go foward unequiped. 
And make sure you also have potions. I see some of them in your way, be sure to always have some."
--XX--
