"Oh, Hello. It's nice to meet someone down here. I'm Iadala. Don't look at me like this. Just because I'm in a cell does not mean I'm a bad person. You look troubled by the way. What's wrong, my dear?"
--XX--
"Your sister? I had a sister once. A baby sister. Until one day she was no baby anymore, and decided it was a good idea to sell me. So now I'm here. Turns out King Odrian is not so good with people, I mean fairies like me..."
--XX--
"Look kid, if your sister's down here, I would simply give up on her. They take kids to him sometimes, and sometimes he goes after them himself. She must be as good as dead now. "
--XX--
"What do I mean by dead? Well, you know, alive no-more and all that stuff. You have no idea where you are, do you? Let me give you a good piece of advice. The best you'll get down here. Go away while you still can. This place is dangerous, and just because you are moved by a sence of duty does not mean you have any... what's the word... capabitily. Yeah, that's the one I'm looking for. You are just a kid."
--XX--
"You again? What's your problem, kid? I was liking you until you came with this stupid idea of going on in this place looking for a sister. Maybe he already got you, the way the got all the other ones. Leave me alone now. I must rest while I can. He may come back anytime."
--XX--
"Oh dear, I've told you. I have just no idea where your sister is. You should leave me alone now. He may think I can't do anything anymore... But he's wrong. And I would hate to use it on you, when I can use it on him."
--XX--
"Alrigth, if I tell you a thing will you leave me alone, for good? Great. So, King Odrian lives in a castle faaaar away in the east. There's a gate somewhere down here. If you open it, you should be able to go to the castle. Altough you are mad for trying. None should go there. He takes all the kids there, so as I told you before, do not be so hopeful for your sister. Why? How should I know. I do not have conversations with Child Eaters as often as you may think."
