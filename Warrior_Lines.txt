"What are you doing down here, kid?"

"Your sister? No I did not see anyone."
--XX--
"Wait a minute. How did you get here?."
--XX--
"You came through a hole? Well, a better way to enter then being kipnapped like all of us.
Don't even bother trying to let us out. It's as useless as trying to teach a rock to sing."
--XX--
"You think I look familiar, of course. Some time ago I was a Champion in the Arena. 
A gloriuos one. But now I'm just another random person at a mad warlock's prision. 
You should go by the way. This is not a save place for kids. "
--XX--
"You want to find your sister? Haven't she heard the stories about this cave?
SHE DID? And what kind of idiot would enter a cave filled with demons and monsters?
Kids these days are getting mad. You should all keep a safe distance from places like this."
--XX--
"You are going after her, rigth? Well, I don't know where you could start looking.
Perhaps you should ask my cell mates here."
