"Wait. You are a damn kid. What are you doing down here? 
Looking for your sister. HA! Another one wanting to be a hero. 
I pity you, you know. You'll be dead soon. 
The things that wander around here don't like kids."ï»¿

"Do you think I can help you? You are even dumber then you look.
And I thought it hard to be. If I'd help anyone I'd help myself. 
I'm not good with helping you know? My kind does not do help.
Specially with crazy kids that want to get themselves killed."
--XX--
"Why do I look like a robber? Because I AM, well was.
It does not matter. I should not be here as much as these bastards.
You know nothing kid, don't you look at me with these stupid eyes of yours.
They may work with your fat aunties, but you will get nothing from me."
--XX--
"Go away. I told you I cannot help you. And even if I could,
I wouldn't".
