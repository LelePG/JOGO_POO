"How are you young one? Me? I'm nobody.
At least since I came down here, you know... I'm a musician.
Oh, you noticed. Hahahaha. The finest in these caves..."
--XX--
"Your sister? Oh, what a fine kid you are. I should write a song about you.
What do you think? A brave kid went down to the devil's nest to search for a sister.
A lost sister. With magical powers, oh... I begin to see it now. 
What a fine piece I could write, if I only had my ink... 
A fine musician writes his ï»¿pieces with good ink, you know... 
Otherwise, there's no legacy left once you are gone. But I'm here for so long.
I think I'm already gone."
--XX--
"Oh, sorry, kid. You are asking me if I saw your sister... I did not."
--XX--
"You know, I could be bringing joy to the world with my wonderful voice, but instead,
I'm caged in these caves... You could wonder what have I done wrong.
But so do I. I guess mad warlocks, specially the powerful ones, can aprecciate
good music, but they should at least let the artist play. "
--XX--
"I liked you kid. No one likes talking down here. 
The crazy one there think she's a fairy, and the old man goes on about the future.
The strong guy over there is not strong enough to break us out, and the ugly one that's sleeping 
is so good of a rober that could not even pick that damn lock of that wet cell of his.
So I'll help you. As much as I can, I mean. I saw one of Odrian's man going east with 
something in a sack. I tought it was a animal, but thinking now, it could as well be your sister."
--XX--
"Who's Odrian? No one important. Just the mad man that keeps us all here.
They tell really bad stories about him. Stories that can make even the bravest screm.
But he does not look as bad as you may think. He's been using this cave for a long time.
You must have heard about it. They say he filled the tunnels with some kinds of creatures. 
So if you are going on with this, you should be careful. 
Cause only God knows what may happen if that man gets to you."
