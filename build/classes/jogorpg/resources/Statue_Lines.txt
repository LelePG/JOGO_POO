'What am I? Oh dear, can't you see? I'm just a Statue. 
At least I am now. I was once a person like you, a long time ago... 
But now I'm just a keeper.'
--XX--
'What do I keep? I keep this room of course. 
Well, I do not keep it exactly... I just keep tracks of who is borrowing what...
Speaking of, it's been a long time since King Odrian's men came in to bring new stuff.
I'm starting to fear they forgot me here.'
--XX--
'Sorry, I forgot to ask. Do you need somwthing? 
There's not much left, but feel free to pick anything you want, and if you talk to King Odrian...
Could you tell him to pay me a visit? We were such good friends until he put me in this place...'
--XX--
'That's not important, kid. What happened in the past, it's in the past.
Hey, I don't remember for how long that pie has been here, but you should eat it. You look hungry.'ï»¿
